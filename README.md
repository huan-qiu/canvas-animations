## canvas-animations

Canvas-Animations does one single thing; it turns a spritesheet into an animation. Meanwhile, it offers controls like `fps`, `animationIteraionCount`, `play`, `stop`, `destroy` to suit your particular needs, together with an optional `onAnimationEnd` handler.

### üçæ Features

1. Light as a feather, zero dependency.
2. JS framework free, can be used with any JS framework.
3. Support 3 forms of spritesheet: spritesheet with multiple rows, spritesheet with single row, spritesheet with single column.
4. Configurable animation speed, animation iteration count, autoplay mode.
5. The canvas element generated would be automatically scale to match the dimension of `container` element you have set.
